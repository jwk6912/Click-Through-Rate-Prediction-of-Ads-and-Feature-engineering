# Click Through Rate Prediction of Ads and Feature engineering
 Click Through Rate Prediction in Online Advertisement and Feature engineering
# Introduction
 For CTR (Click-through Rate) prediction, a traditional industrial model would use standard classification algorithms to provide predictions on billions of events per day, using a correspondingly large feature space, and then learn from the resulting mass of data. Therefore, the goal of our group is to build a Machine Learning model that beats standard classification algorithms in real industrial settings by using 11 days worth of Avazu data. Our model may eventually be applied to the advertising industry as a better alternative for traditional models.
